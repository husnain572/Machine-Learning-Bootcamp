    "## Summary of the Model Selection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire workflow is known as the **Model Selection Process**,  \n",
    "one of the most critical aspects of Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 6 Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split dataset into **train, validation, and test sets** (60%-20%-20%)  \n",
    "2. Train the model  \n",
    "3. Apply model to validation dataset  \n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 for multiple models  \n",
    "5. Select the best-performing model  \n",
    "6. Apply that model to the test dataset  \n",
    "7. Compare validation vs. test accuracy to ensure consistency  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we want to **avoid wasting the validation dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, after selecting the best model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the original dataset (60%-20%-20%)  \n",
    "2. Train models on the **training dataset**  \n",
    "3. Evaluate models on the **validation dataset**  \n",
    "4. Select the best-performing model  \n",
    "5. **Combine training and validation datasets** to create a **larger training set**  \n",
    "6. Retrain the selected model on this combined data  \n",
    "7. Apply the retrained model to the **test dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "> By using more data for training, the model may capture richer patterns  \n",
    "> and improve its ability to **generalize** to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach doesn’t always guarantee better performance —  \n",
    "it depends on the **dataset size, variability, and initial model performance**.  \n",
    "Experimentation and evaluation are key to choosing the best strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Model Selection Process** is fundamental to ML success.  \n",
    "It ensures you choose a model that performs **well not only on training data**  \n",
    "but also on **new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining **careful validation** and **robust testing**  \n",
    "helps avoid overfitting and ensures real-world reliability.\n",

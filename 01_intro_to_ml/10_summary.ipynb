    "## Summary of First Session - Machine Learning Zoomcamp\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Introduction to Machine Learning with Cars Data**\n",
    "We start with data about cars, including characteristics (features) and prices (target).  \n",
    "A Machine Learning (ML) model can be used to extract patterns from known information (data) about some cars in order to predict car prices based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Rules-Based Systems vs. Machine Learning**\n",
    "- **Rules-Based Systems:**  \n",
    "  Manually converting rules into code using a programming language and applying them to data to produce outcomes.  \n",
    "  Extracting patterns manually can become complex and challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning:**  \n",
    "  Instead of manually coding rules, ML models automatically extract patterns from data using **Mathematics and Statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Supervised Machine Learning**\n",
    "In supervised learning, models learn from labeled data (with known outcomes) to make predictions on unseen data.  \n",
    "There are three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification:** target is a class (e.g., spam or not spam)  \n",
    "- **Regression:** target is a number (e.g., price)  \n",
    "- **Ranking:** output is a list of items ordered by importance or scores\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**\n",
    "A structured methodology from the 1990s for organizing ML projects, consisting of the following iterative steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Understanding** — identify the problem, understand requirements, measure success, and decide if ML is needed.  \n",
    "2. **Data Understanding** — analyze available data and determine quality, reliability, and sufficiency.  \n",
    "3. **Data Preparation** — transform and clean data, build pipelines, and convert it into tabular form for ML models.  \n",
    "4. **Modeling** — choose and train models, adjust features, and fix data issues to improve performance.  \n",
    "5. **Evaluation** — assess if the model meets business goals and performance metrics.  \n",
    "6. **Deployment** — roll out the model to users, monitor its performance, and ensure scalability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This process is **iterative**, allowing for continuous improvement and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Model Selection**\n",
    "Split data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  \n",
    "Train multiple models, validate performance, select the best one, and finally test it on unseen data to ensure **generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note:* You can reuse the validation data. After choosing the best model, combine the **training** and **validation** datasets to retrain the model before testing on the **test set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Setting Up the Environment**\n",
    "Install the following tools and libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python  \n",
    "- NumPy  \n",
    "- Pandas  \n",
    "- Matplotlib  \n",
    "- Scikit-learn  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The easiest setup option is using **Anaconda**.  \n",
    "> Optionally, you can use **AWS** for cloud-based experimentation and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Introduction to NumPy**\n",
    "NumPy is essential for numerical computations, providing efficient operations on arrays, matrices, and linear algebra functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Linear Algebra**\n",
    "Understanding various types of **vector** and **matrix multiplication**.  \n",
    "Example: creating an **identity matrix** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.eye()\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Introduction to Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas** is a Python library used for processing, analyzing, and manipulating **tabular data** efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*This summary provides a quick recap of the foundational topics covered in the first session of the ML Zoomcamp.*\n"

    "# Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction starts with an explanation about what **Machine Learning (ML)** really is.  \n",
    "You can imagine a task that is normally done by an expert, like getting a good price for selling a car.  \n",
    "The expert takes the data about the car and combines all the characteristics to get their opinion about the fair price.  \n",
    "What the expert does is extract **patterns from the data**.  \n",
    "If a human is able to do this, then a **model** can do the same.\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is about using **features** and **target information** to **train a model** and then use this model to **predict unknown targets**.  \n",
    "In other words, ML is the process of **extracting patterns from data (features + target)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this clearly, you must distinguish between the terms **feature**, **target**, and **model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "- What we know about an object.  \n",
    "- In this example: the characteristics of a car (e.g., mileage, year, brand, engine size).  \n",
    "- A **feature** is a characteristic of an object in the form of a number, string, or more complex form (e.g., location data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target\n",
    "- What we want to **predict**.  \n",
    "- Also called the **label** in some sources.  \n",
    "- During **training**, we use a *labeled dataset* (features + known targets).  \n",
    "- Example: many labeled datasets of cars with their prices are used to predict the price (target) of an unseen car.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "- The **output artifact** of training that contains all the learned patterns.  \n",
    "- Once trained, this model can be used to **make predictions** (i.e., estimate the target) for new data based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model training** is the process where the machine extracts patterns from the given training data.  \n",
    "In simple terms, the **features** are combined with the **target** — this leads to the creation of a **model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Training alone doesn’t make a model useful.  \n",
    "The **real benefit** comes when you **apply the trained model** to new, unseen data (without target values).  \n",
    "By doing this, you obtain a **prediction** for the missing information — in this example, the **price** of a new car.\n",

    "| Process | Input | Output |\n",
    "|----------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| **Training** | Features + Target | Model |\n",
    "| **Prediction** | Features + Model | Predicted Target |\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "- In the **training process**, you use features **and** the target to get the **model**.  \n",
    "- In the **prediction process**, you use only the features and apply the trained model to get a **predicted target variable**.\n",

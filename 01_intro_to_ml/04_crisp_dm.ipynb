    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is an **iterative framework** that helps structure and organize Machine Learning (ML) projects in a manageable way — defining **what needs to happen and in which order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of **6 main steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Understanding**  \n",
    "2. **Data Understanding**  \n",
    "3. **Data Preparation (Feature Engineering)**  \n",
    "4. **Modeling**  \n",
    "5. **Evaluation**  \n",
    "6. **Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "> These steps are not strictly linear — after deployment, we often **iterate** back to earlier stages to refine and improve the model.\n",

    "## Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the business context and objectives before jumping into data or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Identify the business problem.\n",
    "- Detect available data sources.\n",
    "- Specify requirements, premises, and constraints.\n",
    "- Clarify risks and uncertainties.\n",
    "- Determine whether the problem is important enough to solve.\n",
    "- Define success criteria (e.g., cost-benefit analysis).\n",
    "- Evaluate if machine learning is truly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather, inspect, and assess the data available for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Analyze available data sources.\n",
    "- Collect and explore data.\n",
    "- Identify missing or incomplete information.\n",
    "- Assess data reliability, quality, and size.\n",
    "- Determine whether additional data is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Preparation (= Feature Engineering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform and clean the data so it can be fed into ML algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Extract and engineer features.  \n",
    "- Clean the data — remove noise and inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- Build **data pipelines** to convert raw data into structured, clean data.  \n",
    "- Convert data into **tabular format** for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. Applied Machine Learning is basically feature engineering.”*  \n",
    "> — **Andrew Ng**, Stanford University\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Reading:**\n",
    "- [Feature Engineering Article on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) (old but still relevant).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **the actual Machine Learning happens**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network).  \n",
    "- Tune and select model parameters.  \n",
    "- Improve model performance iteratively.  \n",
    "- Select the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sometimes, you may need to go back to **data preparation** to fix data issues or engineer better features.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remember:** Model quality heavily depends on data quality.  \n",
    "> → “Garbage in, garbage out!”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess how well the model addresses the **original business problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Measure performance using appropriate metrics.  \n",
    "- Check if business goals were met (e.g., *Reduce spam by 50%*).  \n",
    "- Compare actual results vs. expected outcomes.  \n",
    "- Evaluate on a **test group** before full deployment.  \n",
    "- Conduct a **retrospective**:\n",
    "  - Was the goal achievable?\n",
    "  - Did we measure the right things?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible decisions:**\n",
    "- Adjust goals and retrain.  \n",
    "- Roll out the model to all users.  \n",
    "- Stop the project if objectives are met or unfeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Evaluation + Deployment (Often Happen Together)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform **online evaluation** using **live user data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Deploy the model for a limited group of users.  \n",
    "- Collect feedback and evaluate real-world performance.  \n",
    "- If results are satisfactory — proceed to full deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Deployment (= Engineering Practices)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key actions:**\n",
    "- Roll out the model to all users.  \n",
    "- Implement proper **monitoring** and **maintenance** systems.  \n",
    "- Ensure **scalability**, **reliability**, and **quality**.  \n",
    "- Prepare a final project report documenting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When a model is deployed — it must be reliable, maintainable, and ready for scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Iterate!\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning projects require **continuous iteration**.  \n",
    "After deployment, revisit **Business Understanding** to check if:\n",
    "- The problem needs redefinition.  \n",
    "- The model can be improved further.  \n",
    "- A new version of the model is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule of thumb:**  \n",
    "> - Start simple (use a basic model).  \n",
    "> - Learn from feedback.  \n",
    "> - Improve gradually.\n",

    "# Rule-Based Systems vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rule-Based Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **rule-based system**, you manually define rules to distinguish between *ham* (normal emails) and *spam*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You start by setting up rules — and at first, everything works fine.  \n",
    "However, as new types of spam appear, you constantly need to **adjust the rule set**, creating an endless loop of maintenance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the system becomes:\n",
    "- Harder to manage   \n",
    "- Less flexible  \n",
    "- Prone to breaking when new patterns emerge  \n",
    "\n",
    "This endless reconfiguration is often called the **“hamster wheel” problem** — you’re always updating rules but never fully catching up.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to implement a spam filter is to use **Machine Learning (ML)** instead of hand-coded rules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect the data**  \n",
    "2. **Define and calculate (extract) features**  \n",
    "3. **Train the model**  \n",
    "4. **Apply the model to new data**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Collect the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can collect data automatically while using the **“SPAM”** or **“Not SPAM”** button in your email system.  \n",
    "Each click generates a labeled example (spam = 1, no spam = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define & Extract Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To create features, start from the same ideas you would use for rules in the rule-based system — but now turn them into measurable characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature Description | Type | Example Value |\n",
    "|----------------------|------|----------------|\n",
    "| Length of title > 10? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "| Length of body > 10? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "| Sender = “promotions@online.com”? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "| Sender = “hpYOSKmL@test.com”? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "| Sender domain = “test.com”? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "| Description contains “deposit”? | Binary | 1 / 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each email can be represented as a binary vector, for example:  \n",
    "`[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each email also has a **label/target**:\n",
    "- `1` → spam  \n",
    "- `0` → not spam  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is used to **train** (or *fit*) the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the model finds relationships between features and labels — similar to solving a complex system of equations with many parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each feature is assigned a **weight**, showing how much it contributes to predicting spam.  \n",
    "- The goal is to **minimize the classification error** between predicted and actual labels.  \n",
    "- The result is a **trained model** containing the optimized weights that best separate spam from non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Applying the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying the model to **unknown data (new emails)**:\n",
    "- The model outputs a **probability** — e.g., `0.85` → 85% chance of being spam.  \n",
    "- A **threshold** (commonly `0.5`) is used to make a final decision:\n",
    "  - If `P(spam) ≥ 0.5` → classify as **spam**\n",
    "  - If `P(spam) < 0.5` → classify as **not spam**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process replaces rigid rules with **learned patterns**, making the system adaptive and more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Description |\n",
    "|------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Rule-Based System** | Manually create and adjust rules. Becomes complex and hard to maintain. |\n",
    "| **Machine Learning** | Collect data, extract features, train model, and make predictions using learned patterns. |\n",
